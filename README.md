# s(M)exoscope

This is Bram de Jong's classic **s(M)exoscope** plug-in with the source code cleaned up, documented, and modernized for JUCE 8.

Unfortunately, the original smartelectronix site is defunct now but Bram was kind enough to upload [his plug-in source code](https://github.com/bdejong/smartelectronix/tree/master) to GitHub.

This version is based on [Armando Montanez's JUCE port](https://github.com/armandomontanez/smexoscope) from 2016 and [Jason Perez's fixes](https://github.com/jasonmarkperez/smexoscope-mac). However, I changed almost everything. :smile:
